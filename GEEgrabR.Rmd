# Most likely the best way to export will be to batch export image collections to drive using the fittoprecipe batch script and then to use the googledrive R package to download the files to the project data folder. However, ask Matt Ross if he has any protips for grabbing imagecollections directly from GEE using the earthEngingGrabR package
